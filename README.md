# rsfunge

rsfunge is mostly a learning project for me and it's still in developement.

Some features that are planned (or would be nice but require a lot of work):
* Finish the implementation
* Improve the cli
* Add various environment options like "Disable concurrent funge", given via settings file or cli maybe
* Add a commandline debugger that stores breakpoints, etc. in a debugging file
* Implement standard fingerprints
* Actually support Befunge93 (via constexprs and generics to make it fast)
* Maybe (really big maybe) implement a simple JIT
