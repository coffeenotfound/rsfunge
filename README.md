# rsfunge

rsfunge is an interpreter written in Rust for Befunge-93 and the Funge-98 family of esoteric languages.

Note that rsfunge is still under developement!

Some features that are planned (or would be nice but require a lot of work):
* Finish the implementation
* Improve the cli
* Add various environment options like "Disable concurrent funge", given via settings file or cli maybe
* Add a commandline debugger that stores breakpoints, etc. in a debugging file
* Implement standard fingerprints
* Actually support Befunge93 (via constexprs and generics to make it fast)
* Maybe (really big maybe) implement a simple JIT
